🌟 Journey with Machine Learning! 🌟

Platform: Google Colab
Excited to share that I’ve developed a Machine Learning model to predict organ transplant eligibility! 🚀

Datasets:
There are used 2 random dataset created ny own. This project focuses on only the practice with ML.

🧠 What’s It About?
Organ transplantation is complex and time-sensitive. My model predicts whether a patient is eligible for the transplantation process with a donor available in their proximity. This ensures that the process is not only efficient but also location-aware, improving the chances of a successful transplant.

🛠️ How I Built It:
1. Researched key eligibility factors.
2. Prepared and preprocessed a detailed dataset.
3. Trained 4 models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.

🧪 Evaluation:
Match Score: 0 | Eligibility: 0.0 (<0.95)
Message: "Not eligible for transplantation at this time."
Match Score: 1 | Eligibility: 1
Message: "Congratulations! You’re eligible for transplantation!"

🚀 Why It Matters?
This model makes organ allocation faster, fairer, and more efficient, ultimately saving lives.
